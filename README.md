**Project Title**:  Student Nutrition Survey Analysis

**Overview:**

This repository contains the code and analysis for a survey conducted on student nutrition. The survey aimed to understand various aspects of student dietary habits, nutritional awareness, and perceptions of campus food options. The analysis includes data preprocessing, statistical analysis, visualization, and hypothesis testing to derive insights from the survey responses.

**Key Features:**

Data preprocessing: Renaming columns, encoding categorical variables, and handling outliers.
Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistics, value counts, and correlation analysis.
Visualization: Graphical representation of survey responses using matplotlib and seaborn.
Hypothesis testing: Conducting z-tests and t-tests to assess relationships within the data.
Conclusion: Summarizing insights and implications for student well-being and campus initiatives.

**File Structure:**
